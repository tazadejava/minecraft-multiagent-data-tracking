    <h1>Action Tracker Plugin API</h1>
    <p>
        Action Tracker Plugin, developed the Summer of 2020 by Darren Lim, UROP, for use in the ASIST project at MIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here you can find the documentation for the project, which primarily aimed at being a viable recommendation system that could help players
        with traversing through a search-and-rescue mission as effectively as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this plugin is compiled using Maven, if changes are made to the project with the intent of deployment in a server-environment, Maven can package the jar for transfer to the server folder simply via the "mvn package" command.
        The result will be stored in the target folder, which then can be copied over to the server's plugins folder for use.
